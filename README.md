# StreetEasy Project

This project is focused on using linear regression, applying learnings from a machine learning course. By utilizing multiple features, the objective is to develop and improve the models accuracy of forecasting property rental prices across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. The project consist of training and testing datasets to fit the model and assess the performance.

## Features

- Model Training: Utilizes training and testing datasets to develop the model and assess the performance.
- Performance metric: Employs the coefficient of determination (RÂ²) to evaluate the model effectiveness.
- Coefficient Analysis: Examination of model-generated coefficients to identify opportunities for improving model accuracy.

## Setup and installation
You can see the Jupyter Notebook [here](StreetEasy%20Model.ipynb) or can install it locally using the next steps:

**Prerequisite**: This project requires Jupyter Notebook to be installed. If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can find installation instructions at the [documentation](https://jupyter.org).

To set up and show the notebook locally, follow these steps:
1. Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Joel-Milla/StreetEasy_LinearRegression.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook to access the .ipynb files.
3. Run cells sequentially using `Shift + Enter`.
